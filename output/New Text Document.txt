sometimes generating songs that are super long.
drums pattern needs to be corrected.
maybe layer the generation multiple times, so it generates on the same data a few times.
drums follow rules, so do song 4 by 4. then can switch to different drums, with a different drum play on the switch, can use this to better the others.
